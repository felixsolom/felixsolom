# Felix Solomon

Backend developer building cloud-native services in Go. I've deployed applications to GCP and AWS, implemented OAuth2 authentication systems, and automated CI/CD pipelines. Career-transitioned from 20 years in technical leadership where I automated workflows and managed complex projects under tight deadlines.

**Currently:** Building backend services | Learning distributed systems and microservices patterns | Open to junior backend engineering roles

## üöÄ Featured Projects

### [Fetch-Duck](https://github.com/felixsolom/fetch-duck) ‚Äì Automated Invoice Processor
**Tech:** Go ‚Ä¢ Chi ‚Ä¢ Sqlc ‚Ä¢ PostgreSQL ‚Ä¢ Cloud Run ‚Ä¢ AWS S3 ‚Ä¢ GitHub Actions

Full-stack REST API that eliminates manual bookkeeping for freelancers by scanning Gmail for invoices, staging them in a database, and posting to Green Invoice API.

**Technical Highlights:**
- Implemented concurrent Gmail polling with goroutines for improved performance
-  Designed normalized schema with foreign key relationships for invoice tracking and user management using Turso (distributed SQLite)
- Built custom HTTP middleware for authentication, request validation, and error handling
- Automated deployment pipeline: linting, security scanning, Docker builds, and Cloud Run deployment on every commit
- Google OAuth2 integration with stateful, database-backed session management

**Impact:** Handles 200+ invoice scans per user monthly; reduces bookkeeping time by ~70%

### [Flocking-Boids](https://github.com/felixsolom/flocking-boids) ‚Äì Algorithm Simulator
**Tech:** Python ‚Ä¢ Tkinter

Real-time simulation of emergent flocking behavior using the classic "Boids" algorithm, demonstrating complex systems arising from simple rules.

**Technical Highlights:**
- Implemented spatial optimization using proximity-based neighbor detection
- Handles 200+ entities at 60fps with efficient collision detection
- Interactive parameter controls for cohesion, separation, alignment, and obstacle avoidance
