# Felix Solomon

Backend developer building cloud-native services and AI-powered tools. I've deployed applications to GCP and AWS, implemented OAuth2 authentication systems, and built secure agentic AI systems with Docker sandboxing. Career-transitioned from 20 years in technical leadership where I automated workflows and managed complex projects under tight deadlines.

**Currently:** Building backend services | Exploring AI engineering and distributed systems | Open to junior backend engineering roles

## 🚀 Featured Projects

### [Fetch-Duck](https://github.com/felixsolom/fetch-duck) – Automated Invoice Processor
**Tech:** Go • Chi • Sqlc • PostgreSQL • Cloud Run • AWS S3 • GitHub Actions

Full-stack REST API that eliminates manual bookkeeping for freelancers by scanning Gmail for invoices, staging them in a database, and posting to Green Invoice API.

**Technical Highlights:**
- Implemented concurrent Gmail polling with goroutines for improved performance
- Designed normalized schema with foreign key relationships for invoice tracking and user management using Turso (distributed SQLite)
- Built custom HTTP middleware for authentication, request validation, and error handling
- Automated deployment pipeline: linting, security scanning, Docker builds, and Cloud Run deployment on every commit
- Google OAuth2 integration with stateful, database-backed session management

**Impact:** Handles 200+ invoice scans per user monthly; reduces bookkeeping time by ~70%

### [Honey Comb](https://github.com/felixsolom/honey-comb) – AI-Powered Development Agent
**Tech:** Python • Docker SDK • Google Gemini Pro • API Integration

Production-ready agentic AI system that autonomously modifies codebases using Google's Gemini Pro with function calling—demonstrates advanced AI engineering and security practices.

**Technical Highlights:**
- Implemented secure Docker sandboxing for code execution with path traversal prevention, resource limits (512MB memory, 50% CPU), and network isolation
- Architected multi-tool agent with 7+ capabilities: file operations, Git integration, web search (DuckDuckGo), and Python execution with comprehensive error handling
- Developed with strict type safety using Pyright, proper exception hierarchies (docker.errors), and modern Python tooling (uv package management)
- Built user confirmation workflows for destructive operations (file writes, commits) ensuring safety while maintaining autonomous capabilities
- Rich CLI interface with Markdown rendering and streaming responses

**Impact:** Demonstrates production-quality AI agent development with security-first architecture

### Additional Work

**Static Site Generator** (Go) – CLI tool that converts Markdown to HTML with templating  
**Maze Solver** (Python) – Pathfinding visualization with multiple algorithm implementations  
**Asteroids Clone** (Python) – Classic game with collision physics and vector math

All projects available on [GitHub](https://github.com/felixsolom).
